# Architecture

The Condo is split into a **deterministic simulation core** and a **presentation layer**.
The core decides *what happens*; the presentation layer decides *how it looks and sounds*.
The core never touches cameras, meshes or audio players, so it runs headless at any speed,
which is what makes seeded replays and simulated playthroughs possible.

## Modules

| Module | File | Kind | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| EventBus | `scripts/core/event_bus.gd` | autoload | Typed signals only. No logic. |
| WorldState | `scripts/core/world_state.gd` | autoload | Authoritative state: act, objective, flags, clues, player room, doors, lights, variants, entity, event history, ending. Mutated only through explicit methods, each of which emits on EventBus. `reset()` for tests. |
| Settings | `scripts/core/settings.gd` | autoload | Player options in `user://settings.cfg`. |
| ApartmentLayout | `scripts/world/apartment_layout.gd` | static data | Rooms, walls, doors, lights, anchors, variant areas. The builder, RoomGraph and the tests all read this one file. |
| RoomGraph | `scripts/world/room_graph.gd` | RefCounted | Room connectivity for any variant set: neighbours, BFS paths, reachability. |
| PlayerController | `scripts/player/player_controller.gd` | CharacterBody3D | Walk, sprint, crouch (with headroom check), mouse look, phone light, footsteps. `scripted_move` lets tests drive it. |
| InteractionSystem | `scripts/player/interaction_system.gd` | RayCast3D | 2.2 m reach. Anything with `get_prompt()` + `interact()` is interactable; an empty prompt means "not now". |
| HorrorEvent | `scripts/horror/horror_event.gd` | Resource | Event definition (id, intensity, cooldown, duration, act range, channels, behaviour weights) plus the `prepare / start / update / finish` hooks. Tuned values live in `resources/horror_events/*.tres`. |
| EventScheduler | `scripts/horror/event_scheduler.gd` | RefCounted | Lifecycle `IDLE → VALIDATED → RUNNING → COMPLETED / CANCELLED / FAILED`, cooldowns, channel locks, priority pre-emption, timeouts, queued story requests. |
| BehaviorProfiler | `scripts/horror/behavior_profiler.gd` | RefCounted | Turns 10 Hz player samples into bounded 0–1 signals (EMAs, decayed room time, last-8 outcome window). |
| HorrorDirector | `scripts/horror/horror_director.gd` | RefCounted | 4 Hz utility scoring of eligible events, tension model, recovery gaps, seeded pick, explainable decision log. |
| EntityController | `scripts/world/entity_controller.gd` | RefCounted | Unseen presence: `dormant → observing → approaching → retreating`, located in a room of the RoomGraph. |
| RoomTransformer | `scripts/world/room_transformer.gd` | RefCounted | Applies predefined variants only after the five safety checks pass. |
| StoryDirector | `scripts/story/story_director.gd` | RefCounted | Acts, objectives, dialogue, clues, fail-safes, endings. |
| HorrorRuntime | `scripts/horror/horror_runtime.gd` | Node | Composition root for the core; one seeded RNG; fixed tick order. |

## Determinism

* One `RandomNumberGenerator`, seeded once, shared by every core system in a fixed call order.
* The core advances only through `HorrorRuntime.step(dt)`, which reads the player through the
  `HorrorStage` (position, facing, speed, phone light). Given the same seed and the same sequence of
  stage states and interactions, the director makes the same decisions; a unit test replays a trace
  twice and compares the decision logs.
* Presentation randomness (flicker patterns, footstep variation) uses its own RNG and never feeds
  back into the core.

## Visibility

Room swaps and silhouettes need "can the player see this point?". The core asks a `HorrorStage`:

* `HorrorStage` (base) answers from the room graph: a point is visible when its room is the
  player's room or adjacent through an opening or an open door. Simulated playthroughs use this.
* `GameStage` (in-game) checks the camera frustum and a physics ray from the camera to each probe point.

## Renderer

The project uses the **Compatibility** (OpenGL 3 / WebGL2) renderer so one project exports to the web
(itch.io) and to desktop. Avoid Forward+-only features: SDFGI, SSAO/SSIL, volumetric fog, decals.

## Collision layers

| Layer | Name | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | world | walls, floors, furniture, doors, interactables |
| 2 | player | the player capsule |

Room membership comes from `ApartmentLayout.room_at(position)` (a point-in-rect test against the
active variant's rects), not from Area3D triggers, so it is exact and identical in simulation.

## Deviations from the brief's repository layout

* `scripts/core/save_manager.gd` is not present. A 10–15 minute run does not need save slots;
  `Settings` persists options. Add a save manager if checkpoints become necessary.
* Room detection uses layout rects instead of Area3D triggers (see above).
* The graybox is built in code from `ApartmentLayout` by `ApartmentBuilder` rather than hand-placed
  in `.tscn` files, so geometry, the room graph and the tests cannot drift apart. Replacing the
  graybox with modelled rooms means swapping the builder's mesh calls, not the data.
* `scenes/corridor/` and `scenes/entities/` are folded into the builder and `scenes/main.tscn`.
* Story code lives in `scripts/story/` (not listed in the brief).

## References consulted

No third-party code or assets are used. Reviewed for approach only:

* Godot 4 docs: CharacterBody3D, AnimatableBody3D, RayCast3D, AudioStreamPlayer3D, `--headless`.
* MIT first-person controllers ([epergo/character-controller](https://github.com/epergo/character-controller),
  ColormaticStudios/quality-godot-first-person). Both are larger than needed (state machines, swim/fly);
  the controller here is a ~120-line CharacterBody3D written from the engine docs.
